OpenEmbedded/Yocto Linux BSP for NXP Auto platforms
===================================================


First time setup
----------------

To get the BSP you need to have `repo` installed.
Install the `repo` utility: (only need to do this once):

$: mkdir ~/bin
$: curl http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo  > ~/bin/repo
$: chmod a+x ~/bin/repo
$: PATH=${PATH}:~/bin


Download the Yocto Project Environment into your directory:
-----------------------------------------------------------

$: mkdir fsl-auto-yocto-bsp
$: cd fsl-auto-yocto-bsp
$: repo init -u https://bitbucket.sw.nxp.com/scm/alb/fsl-s32v-yocto-bsp.git -b rocko-develop
$: repo sync

This will download the sources for the latest NXP Auto Linux BSP (from the branch rocko-develop),
structured ontop of the Yocto rocko release and upstream NXP QorIQ SDK.

Note: for another Linux BSP release, please use the corresponding branch.


Creating a Build Directory for a BSP release:
---------------------------------------------

Now you can create a build directory in the BSP root by running the command:

$ . setup-env -D <distro> -e <extra-layers> -m <machine>

For the NXP Auto Linux BSP, you should use:
<distro>		fsl-auto
<extra-layers>	meta-alb
<machine>		any NXP Auto target, e.g. s32v234evb, s32v234bbmini etc.


Build an image:
---------------

In the buid directory created by `setup-env`, you can run the command:

$ bitbake <image-name>

For the NXP Auto BSP, you may use as <image-name> any of the Auto images , e.g.
`fsl-image-auto`.

Running the above command would be enough to completely build u-boot, kernel, modules,
and a rootfs ready to be deployed. Look for a build result in
`build_<machine>/tmp/deploy/images/`.

The file `<image-name>.sdcard` is a disk image with all necessary partitions and contains
the bootloader, kernel and rootfs. You can just low-level copy the data on this file to the
SD card device using dd as on the following command example:

$ sudo dd if=<image-name>.sdcard of=/dev/sd<partition> bs=1M && sync

Ensure that any partitions on the card are properly unmounted before writing
the card image, or you may have a corrupted card image in the end.
Also ensure to properly "sync" the filesystem before ejecting the card to ensure
all data has been written.

To deploy only the rootfs to the target partition, run:
$ sudo tar -xzf <image-name>.tar.gz -C <destination>
where <destination> is the destination partition (as mounted on the host).

Note that builds with bitbake accumulate in the deployment directory.
You may want to delete older irrelevant images after repeated builds.
The very first build ever will take very long because a lot of one-time house keeping
and building has to happen. You want to have a powerful build machine.

Note the SOURCE_THIS file to be used when going back to building with a new shell.
